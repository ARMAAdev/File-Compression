# Simple File Compression Software

This is a simple file compression software implemented in C using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm. The software reads an input file, compresses its contents using RLE, and writes the compressed data to an output file.

## Features

- **Simple compression** using Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- **Command-line interface** for specifying input and output files

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -o compress compress.c
